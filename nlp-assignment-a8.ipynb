If we go from 1/4 of the total number of pixels in a window to 4, this represents the ratio of pixels to pixels for each pixel of the window.\n","A. It would be a rather difficult calculation in a way if we had gone from 0 to 0. Hence if we go from 1/4 of the total number of pixels in a window, our total number of pixels would be 0.\n","In the past, it's been suggested that multiplying 1/4 of the total number of pixels in a window would be impossible with just the number of pixels in the window, not necessarily the fact that the same number of pixels in the window would be multiplied. However, we can now be confident that at least the sum of the two values in the window would be correct and that the sum of two values in the window would be correct even if we were not using the same number of pixels in the window. Additionally, the multiplication function doesn't work for all three values, as we can't do the multiplication function. Therefore, we can add the sum of two values in each of the respective values without multiplying each other with one (although, given the number of pixels in the window, it would be possible to multiply the two 2 values in the window while the multiplication function is used). This, in turn, gives us an additional factor of 1: it's more of the same number as the sum of two values in the window.\n","However, that's incorrect. The multiplication function is used here to convert the integers in the window into the number of pixels we need, and that's due to the fact that the equation we created is not even equivalent to the number of pixels in the window. It would be an unnecessarily long calculation. You can change the equation by adding the following equation:\n","In our example we are using the following equation.\n","A. Then, we calculate the size of the size of the window, which would represent the number and space we needed, and multiply 3 to 2 based on the number of pixels in the window.\n","A. Then, we calculate the space from 0 to 0 by multiplying the value of the input and subtracting the value of the input from it. In our example, we want to add the value of the text (n'n').\n","A number generator will generate a function such as function function(\"x,y,z\",n(n):\",1):\",2):\",3):\",4):\",5):\",6):\",7:\",8:\",9\":\",10\":\",11\":\",12\":\",13\":\",14\":\",15\":\",16\":\",17\":\",18\":\",19\":\",20\":\",21\":\"\",22\":\"\",23\":\",24\":\",25\":\",26\":\"\",27\":\",28\":\"\",29\":\"\",30\":\"\",31\":\"\",32\":\",33\":\",34\":\",35\":\"\",36\":\"\",37\":\"\",38\":\"\",39\":\"\",40\":\"\",41\":\"\",42\":\"\",43\":\"\",44\":\"\",45\":\"\",46\":\"\",47\":\",48\":\"\",49\":\"\",50\":\"\",51\":\"\",52\":\"\",53\":\"\",54\":\"\",55\":\"\",56\":\"\",57\":\"\",58\":\"\",59\":\"\",60\":\"\",61\":\"\",62\":\"\",63\":\"\",64\":\"\",65\":\"\",66\":\"\",67\":\"\",68\":\"\",69\":\"\",70\":\"\",71\":\"\",72\":\"\",73\":\"\",74\":\"\",75\":\"\",76\":\"\",77\":\"\",78\":\"\",79\":\"\",80\":\"\",81\":\"\",82\":\"\",83\":\"\",84\":\"\",85\":\"\",86\":\"\",87\":\"\",88\":\"\",89\":\"\",90\":\"\",92\":\"\",93\":\"\",94\":\"\"\",95\":\"\",96\":\"\",97\":\"\",98\":\"\",99\":\"\",100\":\"\",101\":\"\",102\":\"\",103\":\"\",104\":\":\"\",105\":\":\"\",106\":\":\"\",107\":\":\"\",108\":\":\"\",109\":\":\"\",110\":\":\"\",111\":\":\"\",112\":\":\"\",113\":\":\"\",112\":\":\"\",115\":\":\"\",117\":\":\"\",118\":\":\"\",115\":\":\"\",113\":\":\"\",120\":\":\":\"\",116\":\":\"\",117\":\":\"\",118\":\":\"\",119\":\":\"\",117\":\":\"\",120\":\":\"\",117\n"]}],"source":["from transformers import pipeline\n","\n","# Initialize the text generation pipeline\n","text_generator = pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=saved_model, tokenizer=saved_tokenizer)\n","# Input prompt\n","prompt = \"Explain why the following fraction is equivalent to 1/4\"\n","# Text Generation\n","generated_text = text_generator(prompt, max_length=1024, num_return_sequences=1)[0]['generated_text']\n","# Generated text\n","print(generated_text)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-27T16:15:35.029709Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-27T16:15:35.029326Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-27T16:15:35.037298Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-27T16:15:35.036334Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-27T16:15:35.029679Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Function to calculate cosine similarity between two texts\n","\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n","\n","def calculate_cosine_similarity(text1, text2):\n","    tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n","    tfidf_matrix = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform([text1, text2])\n","    cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[0], tfidf_matrix[1])[0][0]\n","    return cosine_sim\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Comparision with Alpaca Gold Label"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":194,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-27T16:15:47.870696Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-27T16:15:47.869823Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-27T16:23:10.673986Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-27T16:23:10.672580Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-27T16:15:47.870664Z"},"id":"9ETPQt8nvMbl","outputId":"580ce580-2ae4-445b-d067-939dc6020dab","trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["What are the names of some famous actors that started their careers on Broadway?
